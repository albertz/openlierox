Introduction
============

Boost.Process is a project that aims to develop a portable and free
process management library for the C++ language.  It is being designed
in a way that will permit the eventual integration into the Boost
libraries.  See http://www.boost.org/ for more information.

This directory contains Boost.Process' source code and documentation.
The rest of this document describes how to build them.

Configuring the build system
============================

This section contains a quick overview on how to set up the Boost.Build
build system.  It is NOT meant to replace the official documentation,
which is much more complete than this and which you should read in case
of doubt.

WARNING: You should use a Boost source tree checked out from the CVS.
A formal release may not work at all with this code.

Before you can build Boost.Process, you must first configure your
environment to meet the following requirements:

1) Have an up-to-date bjam utility in your PATH.  As said above, this
   needs to come from a CVS build.

2) Set BOOST_ROOT to point to Boost's top-most source directory.
   This is the root directory of a Boost source tree distribution and it
   contains subdirectories such as 'boost', 'libs' and 'tools'.

3) Set BOOST_BUILD_PATH to point to the directory containing the
   Boost.Build v2 infrastructure files.  This can be found in the
   'tools/build/v2' subdirectory of the Boost source tree distribution.

You also need to configure Boost.Build v2 and BoostBook to be able to
build the files in this distribution.  Please consult their respective
documentation on how to do this.  As an example, consider this sample
user-config.jam file, which can be placed in your home directory:

----- cut here -----
# Configure the toolset.
import toolset : using ;
using darwin ;

# Configure BoostBook.
using boostbook
  : /usr/pkg/share/xsl/docbook
  : /usr/pkg/share/xml/docbook/4.2
  ;
using xsltproc : /usr/pkg/bin/xsltproc ;

# Use a prebuilt and safely-stored QuickBook binary.
using quickbook : /Volumes/Projects/boost/local/bin/quickbook ;
----- cut here -----


Building
========

Once you have configured your build environment you can build the included
examples, the test suite or the documentation.  To do so, just change into
the appropriate directory within 'libs/process' and run 'bjam --v2'.

Given that this library is completely source-based, you can use it in your
own projects by simply telling the compiler to use the directory where
this file lives as another 'include' directory.  Before doing so, though,
be sure to run the test suite and see that there are no errors.

If you have made your way until here, thanks for your interest in
Boost.Process!
