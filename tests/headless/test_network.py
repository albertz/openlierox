"""Headless network-play tests: a dedicated server plus real network clients.

The scenario is issue #973:
a client that joins a game that is *already running* must be able to play.
Two clients tell the cases apart:

* ``c1`` joins while the server is still in the *lobby* -- the control case,
  which works today; its join is what starts the game.
* ``c2`` joins *after* the game has started -- the mid-game join
  that is broken on current master:
  the late joiner never learns the mod,
  gets "invalid mod name (none)" and is kicked.

A client counts as joined once it reaches the ``Playing`` state.
