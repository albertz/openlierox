Liero Xtreme Source Code Release
9/4/2006

By Jason Boettcher
----------------------------------



This directory contains the development release of Liero Xtreme.
It's a snapshot of the version 0.56b build.


Version History
---------------

After v0.56b i decided to redo a lot of the code. 
As i was going through parts, i found more that i wanted/needed to rewrite and in the end the next version (v0.6) was
a near complete rewrite.

Unfortunately many new bugs showed up and some features i removed were of far greater importance to the
community than i thought (eg, lobby).

So what this is a code split. I no longer continue work on v0.56, and because it's a large difference to the new code,
i have decided to release the code to v0.56.

I have kept the current v0.6 version closed source in the event that i decide to continue working on it
(which i hope some day i can).
