TODO
(remember also to look at the bugs on SF)

[X] make correct Debian packages with dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage (!!)
[X] fix: registering is not done on all masterservers (!!)
[X] fix: aiming too fast

[ ] bot: fix building path (there is one rare case where the
    path is going through an obstacle whereby there is
    enough place to go around) (!)
[X] bot: go one step away if too close (!)
[X] bot: don't move too close if shooting is possible (!)
[ ] follow better/faster the way (!)
[ ] bot avoid projectiles (!)
[ ] bot: improve shooting
[ ] fill documentation (README) (!)
[ ] Fix segfaults
	[X] Crash/memory corruption in HTTP class when downloading bigger amount of data (i,e. levels) (!)
      TODO: Perhaps just disable level downloading for beta 4? But it's just a workaround anyway...
	[?] Various segfaults in hardware mode caused by wrong surface locking (!)
	[?] others (!!)
[ ] CChannel calculates wrong pings (too high) (!)
[ ] remove *_WidgetRegistered and CGuiSkin_Destroyer hacks (!)

[?] fix: FPS (dropped to 60 from 120 here!) (!)
[?] fix network interpolation (is currently not optimal) (!!)
[?] gfx is wrong in some situation or makes problems, fix that (!!)
[?] Fix memory leaks (!!)
[?] nMaxFPS = 0 works correctly? (!!)
[?] finish mouse-aiming (!!)
[?] are there new network errors? (!!)
[?] fix: sometimes you got into chat while playing online on some keys (!!)

[ ] Multiple UDP masterservers - just switch to another one if masterserver won't answer,
    don't open another socket for each mastrserver, it's too complicated (assigned to pelya)
[ ] merge CButton and CTextButton
[ ] fix file downloading (!)
[ ] remove ReadInteger/ReadFloat/Read... from code and use IniParser instead (!)
[ ] remove all unneeded ProcessEvents() from the code
    (even net-messages through events now, so there should
     be almost no part where it is still needed) (!)
[ ] sometimes the pathfinding returns a path through some walls
    Though mostly in this cases it's easy to go around so it
    doesn't make much trouble (mostly). But should be fixed though. (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] write general event-based HttpClient class which uses TcpClient (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] write general TcpClient class which takes use of the general EventHandler (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] write general EventHandler (which could also be run in an own thread)
    which has an own EventQueue and each event has an EventCallback which
    is called then by the handler; this can be used for net-events to
    be handled in an own thread but event-based (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] fix dedicated server (it's often behaving a bit strange) (!)
[ ] close pipe stream correctly for dedicated server (!)
[ ] local play menu (map selection etc.) should be faster (!)
[ ] remove the SendMessage function from GUI part
    ( obj.SendMessage(..., GET, ...) or
      obj.SendMessage(..., SET, ...) is realy bad
      style and should be replaced by the getter/setter functions )
[ ] recode whole CTF code (!)
[ ] Unify tLXOptions.tGameInfo & the other classes into one. (!)
[ ] more options for the bots, for example restricted weapons or special
    behavior
[ ] restrict weapon settings depending on worm character
[ ] allow more than 5 weapons
[ ] configureable blood
[ ] own directory for mods -> better file management
[ ] create crossbuilding-scripts: (using crossbuilding in GCC)
	[ ] Mac OS X ( + Application Bundle)
	[ ] Windows EXE ( + ZIP package)
	[ ] Linux binary
		[ ] AMD64
		[ ] PPC32
		[ ] x86
		[ ] others
	[ ] Debian package
[ ] bot: more effective use of ninjarope (use closer / more intelligent
    spots) (!)
[ ] new graphics engine (waytracing & pixelcache) (!)
[ ] possibility to change options when playing
[ ] uniform warning/notification/error system (!)
[ ] standalone dedicated server (!)
[ ] select different key for ingame console
[?] fix lobby freeze (!)
[?] make network more stable (!)
[?] increase FPS (and determit, why it is bad in beta2)
[?] improve mediaplayer
[?] improve player profile options (many skins need long load time)
[ ] make physics more like original LX (!)
[ ] better bot aiming (fast numerical pre-physics-calculations) (!)
[ ] add option to save/load weapon selection for player
[ ] allow more than 2 viewports (!)
[?] more general input-system (also with joystick-support) (!)
[ ] possibility to switch bot control / user control of a worm
[ ] allow more than one monitor (let user choose what viewports will be
    displayed on what screen)
[ ] allow a higher resolution (reduce it while playing with LX56?) (!)
[ ] join all viewports, if map is smaller than resolution (!)
[ ] allow different sound settings (44k or 22k / mono or stereo / ...) (!)
[ ] abstraction of the engines (network / physic / ...) (!)
[ ] improve join lobby, merge host lobby and join lobby code (!)
[ ] remove all non-widget drawing from menu system (create new widgets
    or use current ones) (!)

minor things:
[X] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after
    playing (!)
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
