    <p>
      Open Lierox is a side scrolling multiplayer shooter where you control a tiny worm
      that is armed with a range of weapons such as a rocket launcher, shotguns and ninja
      stars.
      Typical gameplay is a deathmatch style where you try to rack up as many kills
      of the other players in a set amount of time.
